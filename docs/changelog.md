# Change history

## Unreleased

- Add module guides with executable examples, a complete installed-package quickstart, clearer
  navigation, and common-use explanations before advanced behavior
  ([#75](https://github.com/viell-dev/slop-effect-schema-http/issues/75)).
- Document every public export in the source and generated declarations; check docblock and Markdown
  TypeScript examples, and align request composition, failure explanations and publication guidance.

## 0.1.0-rc.1 npm availability — 2026-11-03

Published the existing candidate to npm with the same tarball as the GitHub release. Both `rc` and
`latest` identify this prerelease during bootstrap. No API or behavior changes; use the explicit
candidate version when installing.

## 0.1.0-rc.1 — 2026-11-01

First installable candidate for `0.1.0`, initially distributed through GitHub Releases. This
candidate is intended to become stable with documentation, version and release-metadata updates
after the [publication prerequisites](https://github.com/viell-dev/slop-effect-schema-http/issues/2)
are complete.

- Consumer-owned request and response contracts, finite body codecs, ordered response selection,
  retry policies, header-line interoperability, replaceable URL encoding and scoped interactions.
- Preserve literal question marks at the start of declared query keys, including bare keys
  ([#66](https://github.com/viell-dev/slop-effect-schema-http/issues/66)).
- Installable ESM package with strict declarations, all public subpath exports, MIT license and
  source maps; remove the development-only `private` flag.
- Checksummed tarball and runnable synthetic consumer example, verified in an isolated installation.
  Release qualification covers Windows/Linux, Effect 4.0.7/4.1.1 package consumers, and all four
  hostile-server lanes.
- Published installation, compatibility, recovery and release procedures.
- Refresh Effect, ESLint, mdrefine and compatible transitive dependencies, and qualify TypeScript 7
  consumers. The build/lint toolchain retains TypeScript 6 until typescript-eslint supports 7
  ([#69](https://github.com/viell-dev/slop-effect-schema-http/issues/69)).

The [limits](./limits.md) remain part of the contract: finite bodies, client-owned transport and
browser policy, no server generation or general cache. The remaining [release
review](https://github.com/viell-dev/slop-effect-schema-http/issues/67) is recorded separately from
automated qualification.
